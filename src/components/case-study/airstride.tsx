              <p>
                The deals module had to answer a practical question at a glance: which deals need attention right now?
                The previous design required opening each record to understand its state. The redesign introduced a
                clear set of deal states, default, management, and completed, so partnership managers could scan the
                list without drilling in.
              </p>
              <p className="dim">
                A filter component with a warning indicator surfaces deals that need action without badge hunting.
                The primary and tertiary button hierarchy keeps the most common action prominent without cluttering the
                interface with equal-weight options. Partner detail panels open as overlays rather than routing to a
                separate page, so the list context stays intact while the user is working inside a record.

                Connecting a CRM is the moment a user hands over access to sensitive business data. The flow had to

              <p>
                Analytics dashboards for B2B platforms face a familiar tension: the metrics a vendor cares about are
                not the same ones a partner manager cares about. A single fixed layout satisfies nobody. The solution
                was a customise view overlay that lets users control which data surfaces they see and how they are
                arranged, without changing the underlying dataset.
              </p>
              <p className="dim">
                The base dashboard ships with a sensible default. The customisation modal is accessible directly from
                the top bar and applies changes immediately. Features on the roadmap but not yet shipped are kept as
                hidden sections in the Figma file, holding the design work without surfacing it in the live product
                until the engineering work catches up.

              <p>
                Training content in a partner platform serves three separate audiences at once. The Vendor builds and
                publishes modules. The Partner Admin deploys them to their team. The Partner User completes them. Each
                role needed its own view of the same underlying structure, without tripling the management overhead
                behind it.
              </p>
              <p className="dim">
                Content creation offered two paths: upload existing material and have the system structure it into a
                module, or build from scratch manually. Both lead to the same module dashboard. Certification states,
                certified, not yet certified, and partner-certified, gave vendors a legible read on completion across
                their partner base without opening individual records. Empty states were designed for the onboarding
                moment, when a vendor logs in for the first time and the module list is blank.

              <p>
                A content library in a partner platform is not just a file system. The wrong partner seeing draft
                materials, pricing documents, or unreleased product content is a real business risk. The design
                organised content into folders with per-folder access control: who can view it, who can edit it, set
                at creation and adjustable after.

                Three role views, Vendor User, Partner Admin, and Partner User, gave each audience the right level of
                control without surfacing settings they could not act on. Three folder creation paths covered the main
                use cases: build manually, generate structure using AI, or mirror from an existing external source.
                The mirroring flow included a review step where vendors inspect what will be pulled in before
                confirming, reducing the risk of accidentally surfacing content from an unreviewed source.

              <p>
                Vendors managing dozens of partner relationships cannot check in manually. The engagement module
                answers the question a vendor asks at the start of the week: who has gone quiet, and who is active?
                Activity data, logins, content consumed, training completed, deal movement, rolls up into a surface
                that flags disengaged partners without requiring a deep dive into individual records.
              </p>
              <p className="dim">
                The design prioritises signal over noise. Rather than surfacing every data point, the engagement view
                surfaces the partners who have crossed an activity threshold in either direction, so a vendor can act
                quickly on the ones that matter without wading through a full audit log.

              <p>
                The thing I would change is where I started. I began in the interface, working from the existing
                product and conversations with stakeholders. What I did not do first was spend meaningful time inside
                the partner ecosystem industry itself: talking to partnership managers at other companies,
                understanding how they think about vendor relationships, where the real friction lives day-to-day.
              </p>
              <p className="dim">
                That research would have sharpened the problem framing earlier, and likely changed some of the
                decisions made in the first few modules. The stakeholder revision problem would also have benefited
                from an explicit alignment session before the first design was shown, not after. Getting
                decision-makers to agree on criteria before seeing options is harder to arrange than it sounds, but it
                would have saved significant design cycles.
              </p>
              <p className="dim">
                The outcome that mattered: paying customers who saw the new designs said they preferred it, and that
                they would recommend Airstride&rsquo;s UX to other companies. The opportunity cost sits in the
                industry research that did not happen, the depth that might have made the six modules sharper from
                the start.
