          Dexla was scaling fast. New features shipped each cycle, and consistency was being
          argued from scratch every time. The only piece of brand that existed was the logo. The
          rest (typography, colour, spacing, controls) was case-by-case.

        <p className="text-ink-dim">
          Toba joined during the early weeks and we built the system together. The challenge was
          less about visuals and more about agreement. With no shared vocabulary, every new screen
          meant a fresh debate. Cycles grew, repetition crept in, and the brand started feeling
          thinner each release.

            What we built,

        <p className="text-ink">
          We started with a competitive read of Material, Atlassian, and Wise. Useful for
          principles. Less useful for the question we actually had, which was how to build a
          system from scratch while the product was shipping new features each week. Published
          systems describe the rules they ended up with, not the order they arrived at them.
        </p>
        <p className="text-ink">
          The style guide came first. Type ramp, colour, spacing scale, named tokens. Things that
          could be agreed in a room and then referenced in a comment thread. Atomic Design gave us
          the structure to grow into: primitives at the bottom, components in the middle, patterns
          at the top. Whatever we added later had a place to land.
        </p>
        <p className="text-ink">
          The component library followed. Buttons, input fields, modals, navigation bars, cards,
          in that order. The choice was not aesthetic, it was frequency of use across the product.
          A button decision touches more screens than a tooltip decision.
        </p>
        <p className="text-ink">
          The no-code editor needed its own pass. Customers were building apps with Dexla, which
          meant components had to expose customisation surfaces (colour, copy, layout) without
          losing the constraints that kept the output recognisable. The same control had to behave
          in two contexts: ours, where the system was authoritative, and theirs, where the system
          was a starting point.
        </p>
        <p className="text-ink-dim">
          Documentation came last and lived where engineering already worked. In Notion. Each
          component got a page. Each token got a name and a reason.

          The system landed as a style guide, a component library, no-code editor components, and

          names, token names referenced the style guide. The documentation lived where engineering
          already worked, which kept the system close to the people consuming it.

          The system was built while the product was shipping. That meant some primitives went out
