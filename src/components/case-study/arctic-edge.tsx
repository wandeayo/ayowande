          Arctic Edge ships smart cooling tubs with a companion mobile app. The app runs inside
          the Tuya smart-device platform, so an operator pairs the unit, opens the app, and lands
          on the control surface for that specific tub. The redesign covered everything inside
          that device screen.

        <p className="text-ink">
          The platform constraint was Tuya. The app account, the device pairing flow, the

          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="font-medium">There was no system state.</strong> No connection

          From the audit, two things had to be fixed first. The temperature needed to be

            sans. The ring carries the state colour and a thin tick at the target. Scale marks
            (0° and 42°) sit on the arc as a quiet reference.

            <strong className="font-medium">System dock.</strong> Bottom row: schedule, the power

          Typography is restrained. One sans family does most of the work, and the display weight

          quiet labels under each control (or a one-second reveal on first launch) would close
          that gap. The Tuya pairing flow that wraps the app is also a different visual world
          from the Arctic Edge surface inside it. A future version would move more of the entry
          experience into a fully owned wrapper, so the visual language does not shift between
          pairing and use.
